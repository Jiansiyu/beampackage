----------------
2012.12.7 updated database read function, now run period in database support like 5000-5700,5703,5705~5709,5712 5715, here "~","-"," " is same
      now you can generate your own database for your own special run by using import in your database, for example you want to use different target z,just create a file named "bpm_yourrunnumber_0 or 1.dat" and insert the lines below to the file:
"      avail run period:5555-5557
      target z position:-7mm
      import bpm_5494_0.dat          "
      then it will use run period and target z in this file and read others in bpm_5494_0.dat file.
